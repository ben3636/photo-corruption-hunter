# photo-corruption-hunter
Script that pulls files with patterns in the hex that coincide with photo corruption (seen as colored bands on the image)
- This program doesn't support files with spaces in the name. To fix this, batch rename files replacing spaces with something else that's unique and change it back after you run the program
